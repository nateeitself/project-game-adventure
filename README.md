# Adventure Man

The purpose of this game is to complete the Object Oriented Programming Final Project. My hoped is hopefully this game will be useful for the local community.

This game is a text based game. The player will be able to move around the map and interact with the environment. The player will be able to pick up items and use them to solve puzzles. The player will be able to fight monsters and gain experience points. The player will be able to level up and gain new abilities. The player will be able to save and load the game. Also maybe there's plenty of bug and you can write an [issues right here](https://github.com/rizkyhaksono/project-game-adventure/issues).
